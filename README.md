# QR File Transfer Project
## Video Demo: 
#### [URL]
## Description:

This is my small project about web application built with **Flask**.
It allows users to tranfers the files from two different devices. If you use a phone, you can scan the QR code to access the website faster.

In order to transfer the files, first we need to create a room that is a place to store everyfile. For other devices to join that room, we just need to enter the URL or scan the QR code on the phone to access the website.

After that, we just need to press or click on "Upload file" and then "Upload". If you refresh the website, you will see the file appear on the "Uploaded Files" section. Then, if you want to download, you just need to click or press on that file.

Notice: the room will be automatically deleted in 10 minutes in order to save the memory!!!

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Flask
- HTML, CSS, JS (Jinja templates)
- Render (for deployment)
